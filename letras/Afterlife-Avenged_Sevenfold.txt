Afterlife

Like walking into a dream,
So unlike what you've seen
So unsure but it seems,
'cause we've been waiting for you

Fallen into this place, 
just giving you a small taste
Of your afterlife here so stay, 
You'll be back here soon anyway

I see a distant light, 
But girl this can't be right
Such a surreal place to see 
So how did this come to be
Arrived too early

And when I think of all the places
 I just don't belong
I've come to grips with life 
And realize this is going too far

I don't belong here,
we gotta move on dear 
Escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time I'm right 
to move on and on,
Far away from here!

A place of hope and no pain, 
Perfect skies with no rain
Can leave this place but refrain, 
'Cause we've been waiting for you

Fallen into this place, just giving you a small taste
Of your afterlife here so stay, 
You'll be back here soon anyway

This peace on earth's not right 
(with my back against the wall)
No pain or sign of time 
(I'm much too young to fall)
So out of place don't wanna stay, 
I feel wrong and that's my sign
I've made up my mind

Gave me your hand but realize I just wanna say goodbye
Please understand I have to leave and carry on my own life

I don't belong here,
we gotta move on dear 
Escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time I'm right 
to move on and on,
Far away from here!

Got nothing against you,
and surely I'll miss you
This place full of peace and light,
And I'd hope you might take me back inside 
When the time is right

Loved ones back home all crying
'cause they're already missing me
I pray by the grace of God
that there's somebody listening
(I am, unbroken)
Give me a chance to be
(I'm chocking)
the person I wanna be
(on this ecstasy!)
(Unbreak me)
Oh Lord, I'll try so hard
(Unchain me)
but you gotta let go of me
(I need another chance to live!)

I don't belong here,
we gotta move on dear 
Escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time I'm right 
to move on and on,
Far away from here!

Got nothing against you,
and surely I'll miss you
This place full of peace and light,
And I'd hope you might take me back inside 
When the time is right
