Before I Forget

Go!!!!!

Stapled shut, inside and outside world and I'm 
Sealed in tight, bizarre but right at home I'm 
Claustrophobic, closing in and I'm 
Catastrophic, not again 
I'm smearder across the page, and douse in gasoline 
I wear you like a stain 
yet I'm the one who's obscene 
catch me up on all your sorted little insurrections 
I've got no time to lose and 
I'm just caught up in all the cattle 

Fray the strings 
Throw the shapes 
Hold your breath 
Listen!  

I am a world before I am a man 
I was a creature before I could stand 
I will remember before I forget 
Before I forget that! 

Ripped across the ditch, and settled in the dirt and I 
Wear you like a stitch, yet I'm the one who's hurt 
Pay attention to your twisted little indiscretions 
I've got no right to win, I'm just caught up in all the battles 

Locked in clutch 
Pushed in place 
Hold your breath 
listen! 

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand 
I will remember before I forget 
Before I forget that! 

I am a world before I am a man 
I was a creature before I could stand 
I will remember before I forget 
Before I forget that! 

My end 
It justifies my means 
All I ever do is delay 
my every attempt to evade 
The end of the road and my end 
It justifies my means 
All I ever do is delay 
my every attempt to evade 
The end of the road! 

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand 
I will remember before I forget 
Before I forget that! 

I am a world before I am a man 
I was a creature before I could stand 
I will remember before I forget 
Before I forget that! 

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand 
I will remember before I forget 
Before I forget that!

Yeah!!! 3x
