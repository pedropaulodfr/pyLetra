Seize The Day

Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost 
It's empty and cold without you here, 
Too many people to ache over 

I see my vision burns, 
I feel my memories fade with time 
But I'm too young to worry 
These streets we travel on 
Will undergo our same lost past

I found you here, now please just stay for a while 
I can move on with you around 
I hand you my mortal life, but will it be forever? 
I'd do anything for a smile, 
Holding you 'til our time is done 
We both know the day will come, 
But I don't want to leave you 

I see my vision burn, 
I feel my memories fade with time 
But I'm too young to worry 
(a melody, a memory, or just one picture) 

Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost 
It's empty and cold without you here, 
Too many people to ache over 

Newborn life replacing all of us, 
Changing this fable we live in 
No longer needed here so where should we go? 
Will you take a journey tonight, 
Follow me past the walls of death? 
But girl, what if there is no eternal life? 

I see my vision burn, 
I feel my memories fade with time 
But I'm too young to worry 
(a melody, a memory, or just one picture) 

Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost 
Its empty and cold without you here, 
Too many people to ache over 
Trails in life, questions of us existing here, 
Don't wanna die alone without you here 
Please tell me what we have is real 

So, what if I never hold you, or kiss your lips again? 
So I never want to leave you 
And the memories for us to see 
I beg don't leave me 

Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost 
Its empty and cold without you here, 
Too many people to ache over 
Trails in life, questions of us existing here, 
Don't wanna die alone without you here 
Please tell me what we have is real 

(silence you lost me, no chance for one more day) 
I stand here alone 
Falling away from you, 
No chance to get back home
