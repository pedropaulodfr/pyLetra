Zombie

Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistaking?

But, you see it's not me
It's not my family
In your head, in your head
They are fighting
With their tanks and their bombs
And their bombs and their guns
In your head in your head 
they are crying
In your head
In your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie
What's in your head? In your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie

Another mother's breaking
Heart is taking over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken
It's the same old thing since 1916
In your head,
In your head
They're still fighting
With their tanks and their bombs
And their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head 
they are dying

In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie
What's in your head? In your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie
