Aerials

Life is a waterfall
We're one in the river,
and one again after the fall
Swimming through the void
we hear the word
We lose ourselves but we find it all

Cause we are the ones that want to play
Always want to go but you never want to stay
And we are the ones that want to choose
Always want to play but you never want to lose

Aerials In the sky
When you lose small mind you free your life

Life is a waterfall
We drink from the river
then we turn around and put up our walls
Swimming through the void we hear the word
We lose ourselves but we find it all

Cause we are the ones that want to play
Always want to go but you never want to stay
And we are the ones that want to choose
Always want to play but you never want to lose
Oh!

Aerials
In the sky
When you lose small mind you free your life
Aerials
So up high
When you free your eyes eternal prize
Aerials
In the sky
When you lose small mind you free your life
Aerials
So up high
When you free your eyes eternal prize
