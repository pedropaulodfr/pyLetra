Smells Like Teen Spirit

Load up your guns and bring your friends
It's fun to lose and to pretend
She's overbored and self assured
Oh, no, I know a dirty word

Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello

With the lights out its less dangerous
Here we are now entertain us
I feel stupid, and contagious
Here we are now entertain us
A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito
My libido
Yeah!
Hey... Yay!

I'm worse at what I do best
And for this gift I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always will until the end

Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello

With the lights out its less dangerous
Here we are now entertain us
I feel stupid, and contagious
Here we are now entertain us
A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito
My libido
Yeah!
Hey... Yay!

And I forget just why I taste
Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile
I found it hard it's hard to find
Well, whatever, nevermind

Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello

With the lights out it's less dangerous
Here, we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid, and contagious
Here, we are now entertain us
A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito
My libido
