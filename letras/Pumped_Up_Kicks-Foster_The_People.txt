Pumped Up Kicks

Robert's got a quick hand
He'll look around the room
He won't tell you his plan
He's got a rolled cigarette
Hanging out his mouth, he's a cowboy kid
Yeah, he found a six-shooter gun
In his dad's closet
In the box of fun things
I don't even know what
But he's coming for you, yeah
He's coming for you

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run
Better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run
Faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run
 better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run
Faster than my bullet

Daddy works a long day
He be coming home late
And he's coming home late
And he's bringing me a surprise
'Cause dinner's in the kitchen
And it's packed in ice
I've waited for a long time
Yeah, the sleight of my hand
Is now a quick-pull trigger
I reason with my cigarette
And say: "your hair's on fire
You must've lost your wits," yeah

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run
Better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run
Faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run
 better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run
Faster than my bullet


Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run
Better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run
Faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run
 better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run
Faster than my bullet
