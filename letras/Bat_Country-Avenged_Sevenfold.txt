Bat Country

He who makes a beast out of himself 
Gets rid of the pain of being a man 

Caught here in a fiery blaze, 
Won't lose my will to stay. 

I tried to drive all through the night, 
The heat stroke ridden weather, 
The barren empty sights. 
No oasis here to see, 
The sand is singing deathless words to me. 

Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn 
(all alone). 
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction. 
My confidence is leaving me on my own 
(all alone). 
No one can save me and you know 
I don't want the attention. 

As I adjust to my new sights 
The rarely tired lights 
will take me to new heights. 
My hand is on the trigger I'm ready to ignite. 
Tomorrow might not make it but everything's all right. 
Mental fiction follows me; 
Show me what it's like to be set free. 

Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn
(all alone). 
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction. 
My confidence is leaving me on my own 
(all alone). 
No one can save me and you know 
I don't want the attention. 

So sorry you're not here 
I've been sane too long my vision's so unclear. 
Now take a trip with me but don't be surprised 
When things aren't what they seem. 

Caught here in a fiery blaze, 
won't lose my will to stay. 
These eyes won't see the same, 
after I flip today. 

Sometimes I don't know why 
We'd rather live than die, 
We look up towards the sky 
For answers to our lives. 
We may get some solutions 
But more just pass us by, 
Don't want your absolution 
Cause I can't make it right. 
I'll make a beast out of myself, 
Gets rid of all the pain of being a man. 

Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn 
(all alone). 
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction. 
My confidence is leaving me on my own 
(all alone). 
No one can save me and you know 
I don't want the attention.

So sorry you're not here 
I've been sane too long my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me 
But don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem
I've known it from the start all 
These good ideas will tear your brains apart
Scared but you can follow me 
I'm too weird to live but much too rare to die
