Breakthrough

When I lay down
Sun brings dawn
Pure than ever
It holds me in their arms

And I waited...

You may live on a raft
Always sailing
Your own lost way and now,
Just a melt of suffer and tears from all

"Don't ever let me down"
Well, I guess somebody said...
Don't run away from where it rises
So they say the truth meant dawn.

(Chorus)

Breaking all the waves
You rather live like your own hope
Drifting away
Caught up on the wrong road

Who may dream to be left?
Always sailing
Your own lost way just found
Compromising peace and years of love

"Don't ever let me down"
Well, I guess somebody said...
Don't run away from where it rises
So they say the truth meant dawn.

(Chorus)

Breaking all the waves
You rather live like your own hope
Drifting away
Caught up on the wrong road

Breaking all the waves
You rather live like your own hope
Drifting away
Caught up on the wrong road

And all your blame blind to see
This is real life, that is day and night
It's hard to know
What we lost for all those years
But we were young and
Free from the loneliness of mind

(Chorus)

Breaking all the waves
You rather live like your own hope
Drifting away
Caught up on the wrong road

Breaking all the waves
You rather live like your own hope
Drifting away
Caught up on the wrong road

I make my own way
